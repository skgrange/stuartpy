# stuartpy

`stuartpy` is my personal Python package. I am primarily an R developer, but Python offers some great features and I use it for many utilitarian scripting tasks. Functions include: 

  - `xml_to_json`. A robust XML to JSON file converter build upon [**xmltodict**](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict).
  - `pretty_xml`. Pretty print XML documents. 
  - `pretty_json`. Pretty print JSON documents. 
  - `pdf_drop_first_page`. Pretty self explanatory.
